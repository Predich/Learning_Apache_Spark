# Learning Apache Spark 

Website: https://runawayhorse001.github.io/LearningApacheSpark/


This is a shared repository for Learning Apache Spark Notes. The first version was posted on Github in [Feng2017]. This shared repository mainly contains the self-learning and self-teaching notes from Wenqiang during his IMA Data Science Fellowship.

In this repository, I try to use the detailed demo code and examples to show how to use each main functions. If you find your work wasnâ€™t cited in this note, please feel free to let me know.

Although I am by no means an data mining programming and Big Data expert, I decided that it would be useful for me to share what I learned about PySpark programming in the form of easy tutorials with detailed example. I hope those tutorials will be a valuable tool for your studies.

The tutorials assume that the reader has a preliminary knowledge of programing and Linux. And this document is generated automatically by using sphinx.


BTW, I successfully brought git output format into Sphnix in this repository.  You need to install `sphinx-to-github`
and more details can be found from the following reference:

Now, the ``sphinx-to-github`` function for github pages can be easily solved by add an empty file ``.nojekyll `` to your docs folder.  I add the following piece of code in my ``docgen.py`` to add it automatically: 


```
    # add .nojekyll file to fix the github pages issues
    nojekyll_path = os.path.join(outdir, '.nojekyll')
    if not os.path.exists(nojekyll_path):
        nojekyll = open(nojekyll_path,'a')
        nojekyll.close()
```
